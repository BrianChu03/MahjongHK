# HK Style Mahjong game

This project is a Mahjong game that includes different types of Mahjong tiles and their properties. It defines various tile categories, such as suits, honors, and bonus tiles, to be used within the game. The project serves as the foundation for implementing tile-based logic in Mahjong gameplay.

Players can interact with different tile types as part of the game mechanics, and the system ensures proper categorization and handling of Mahjong tiles. The project aims to provide a structured way to represent Mahjong tiles for further development and game logic implementation.
